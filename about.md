I am Sun Zhaole, a first-year PhD student supervised by Prof. [*Robert Fisher*](https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/rbf/) in University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, UK. My research topic lays on dual-arm manipulation and planning, deformable linear object manipulation, and deformable linear object perception.

Before being a PhD student at Edinburgh, I got my bachelor degree from Department of Automation at Tsinghua University, Beijing, China. I finished my Bachelor's thesis supervised by Prof. [*Xiang Li*](https://sites.google.com/view/homepageoflixiang/home) working on 2D Deformable Object Manipulation via Deep Reinforcement Learning Approach. From January 2019 to July 2020, I spent one and a half year as a research intern supervised by [*Anbang Yao*](https://yaoanbang.github.io/) working on Convolutional Neural Network compression and acceleration in Intel Lab China, Beijing, China.

What does my name mean: *Sun Zhaole*, where *Sun(孙)* is my family name but I perfer to put it as the first name. *Sun* is also the family name of *Sun Tzu*, the author of *The Art of War* (Sabaton has a song of this book on [*Youtube*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXO2nrHYJ5c)).  *Zhaole(钊乐)* is my given name. This helps when people want to refer your paper and distriguish you from other authors who have the same name as *Sun*. *Zhaole* means encouragement and happiness, where *Zhao(钊)* is actually inspired from [*Li Dazhao*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Li_Dazhao).
