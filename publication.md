Here is a brief introduction to myself. My name is *Sun Zhaole*, where *Sun(孙)* is my family name but I perfer to put it as the first name. *Zhaole(钊乐)* is my given name. This helps when people want to refer your paper and distriguish you from other authors who have the same name as *Sun*. *Zhaole* means encouragement and happiness, where *Zhao(钊)* is actually inspired from [*Li Dazhao*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Li_Dazhao). 

I am a first-year PhD student in University of Edinburgh supervised by Prof. [*Robert Fisher*](https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/rbf/)
