This is a post for getting started on Nvidia's new simulation environment, Isaac Sim.

Follow this link to [**install and set up Isaac Sim**](https://docs.omniverse.nvidia.com/app_isaacsim/app_isaacsim/requirements.html).

A quick example on using UR10 for simple object picking: [**An example on UR10**](https://docs.omniverse.nvidia.com/app_isaacsim/app_isaacsim/sample_ur10.html)

To run python scripts directly, see [**Run Python Scripts**](https://docs.omniverse.nvidia.com/app_isaacsim/app_isaacsim/python_environment.html)

[**Python Utility Snippets**](https://docs.omniverse.nvidia.com/app_isaacsim/app_isaacsim/python_snippets.html)

[**A Reinforcement Learning Sample for Jetbot**](https://docs.omniverse.nvidia.com/app_isaacsim/app_isaacsim/sample_training_rl.html). Here you need to preprocess the components and create a folder as told before running python scripts.
