Recently, one of my friends become an assistant professor, who gives me some good advice on how to decorade and boardcast my work. Here are several tips:

1. Release your open-source codes to let others reproduce your work and cite it. 
2. Use your twitter to follow the top researchers in your field, and post your research with a short description and feasible figures.
3. If possible, make a good demo video and an introduction video for each of your paper together with a separated web, which is similar to Google's practice.
4. Talk more on conference (though this is not available during pandemic).
