These two weeks I have read about several papers published in recent 5 years on deformable object planning manipulation. Here is the list:

1. Challenges and Outlook in Robotic Manipulation of Deformable Object
2. Survey on Multi-robot Manipulation of Deformable Objects
3. Modeling, Learning, Perception, and Control Methods for Deformable Object Manipulation
4. Robotic Manipulation and Sensing of Deformable Objects in Domestic and Industrial Applications: A Survey
