Simulation has become a mainstream for both robotics learning and testing the algorithms before applying to the real robots. Recently, NVIDIA's [*Omniverse*](https://developer.nvidia.com/nvidia-omniverse-platform), [*Issac Sim*](https://developer.nvidia.com/isaac-sim) powered by Omniverse, and [*Issac Gym*](https://developer.nvidia.com/isaac-gym) built on top of Issac Sim have drawn my eyes for robotics learning and testing for deformable linear object manipulation.

For Issac Gym, NVIDIA has uploaded a technical report paper named [*Isaac Gym: High Performance GPU-Based Physics Simulation For Robot Learning*](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.05762) on Arxiv for a brief introduction.
