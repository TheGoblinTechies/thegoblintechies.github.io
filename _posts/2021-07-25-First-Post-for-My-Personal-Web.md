This is my first official post to really organize my personal page after creating it for more than four years without further management.

Here is a brief introduction to myself. My name is *Sun Zhaole*, where *Sun(孙)* is my family name but I perfer to put it as the first name. 
And *Zhaole(钊乐)* is my given name. This helps when people want to refer your paper and distriguish you from other authors who have the same 
name as *Sun*. *Zhaole* means encouragement and happiness, where *Zhao(钊)* is actually inspired from [*Li Dazhao*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Li_Dazhao). 

I am a first-year PhD student in University of Edinburgh.
